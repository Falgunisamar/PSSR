# PSSR
Creating a robotic system like a pesticide sprayer and grass cutter spider robot involves a combination of hardware and software.  The code for such a robot will depend on the specific hardware components you are using, such as motors, sensors, and controllers. Additionally, you might need a microcontroller or a single-board computer like Arduino or Raspberry Pi to control the robot.
